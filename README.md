# Sales Data Transformation and Business Insights Dashboard

## Introduction

This project demonstrates end-to-end data analysis workflow, transforming raw sales data into actionable business insights through SQL-based data cleaning and Power BI visualization. The solution provides stakeholders with interactive dashboards to monitor sales performance, identify trends, and make data-driven decisions.

## Project Goal

Transform messy, raw sales data into clean, structured datasets and create comprehensive business intelligence dashboards that enable:
- Real-time sales performance monitoring
- Market trend analysis
- Customer behavior insights
- Revenue optimization opportunities

## Tools & Technologies

- **SQL**: Data cleaning, transformation, and analysis
- **Power BI**: Interactive dashboard creation and data visualization
- **MySQL**: Database management and storage
- **Power Query**: Data connection and preprocessing
- **DAX**: Advanced calculations and measures

## Project Workflow

### 1. Data Assessment
- Analyze raw sales dataset structure
- Identify data quality issues (missing values, duplicates, inconsistencies)
- Document data sources and business requirements

### 2. Database Setup
- Import raw data into MySQL database
- Create normalized table structure
- Establish relationships between tables

### 3. Data Cleaning (SQL)
- Remove duplicate records
- Handle missing values and null entries
- Standardize data formats and currency conversions
- Validate data integrity and business rules

### 4. Data Transformation
- Create calculated fields and derived metrics
- Aggregate data for different analysis levels
- Implement data quality checks and validation

### 5. Power BI Integration
- Connect Power BI to cleaned database
- Design data model and relationships
- Create measures using DAX formulas

### 6. Dashboard Development
- Build interactive visualizations
- Implement filters and slicers
- Design user-friendly interface
- Add drill-down capabilities

### 7. Testing & Validation
- Verify data accuracy against source
- Test dashboard functionality
- Gather user feedback and iterate

## Key Features

### Dashboard Capabilities
- **Sales Performance**: Revenue trends, growth rates, and target vs actual analysis
- **Market Analysis**: Regional performance comparison and market share insights
- **Customer Insights**: Top customers, buying patterns, and segmentation
- **Product Analytics**: Best-selling products, category performance, and profitability
- **Time Intelligence**: Year-over-year comparisons, seasonal trends, and forecasting
- **Interactive Filters**: Dynamic filtering by date, region, product, and customer

### Technical Features
- Real-time data refresh capabilities
- Mobile-responsive dashboard design
- Export functionality for reports
- Role-based access control
- Automated data validation alerts

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- MySQL Server installed and running
- Power BI Desktop application
- Access to raw sales dataset

### Setup Instructions

#### 1. Database Setup
```sql
-- Create database
CREATE DATABASE sales_insights;
USE sales_insights;

-- Import data tables (customers, products, transactions, dates)
-- Run provided SQL scripts to create and populate tables
```

#### 2. Data Cleaning
```sql
-- Execute data cleaning scripts
-- Remove duplicates, handle nulls, standardize formats
-- Create normalized currency amounts
```

#### 3. Power BI Configuration
1. Open Power BI Desktop
2. Connect to MySQL database:
   - Server: `localhost` (or your server address)
   - Database: `sales_insights`
   - Authentication: Use your MySQL credentials

3. Load required tables:
   - customers
   - products  
   - transactions
   - date

4. Open the provided `.pbix` file
5. Refresh data connections
6. Verify all visualizations load correctly

#### 4. Dashboard Access
- Navigate through different report pages
- Use filters and slicers to explore data
- Export reports as needed
- Set up automatic refresh schedule
